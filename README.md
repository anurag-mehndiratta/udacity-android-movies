This is the Project 1 and 2 of Udacity Android Nanodegree.

This app:

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow the user to change sort order via a setting:
- Allow the user to sort by most popular or by highest-rated or by favorites
- Allow the user to view and play trailers in a web browser.
- Allow the user to read reviews of a selected movie.
- Allow the user to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
